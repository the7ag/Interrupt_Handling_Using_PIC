# Interrupt Handling Lap with PIC16F877A
This project implements an interrupt handling system using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The lap consists of three main tasks: a temperature-controlled fan, a simple irrigation system, and a garage security system. Each task utilizes different drivers and interrupts to perform specific functions.

## Task 1: Temperature Controlled Fan
The temperature controlled fan is designed to activate when the temperature reaches 50°C or higher. It utilizes interrupts to monitor the temperature and control the fan accordingly. The fan remains ON until the temperature drops below 50°C. Additionally, the elapsed time since the fan was last turned on is displayed on an LCD screen.

## Drivers Used
* GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
* LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
* External Interrupts
* Timer Interrupts

## Task 2: Simple Irrigation System
The simple irrigation system waters plants at regular intervals. It irrigates the plants for 15 seconds every 3 days. A 7-segment display is used to indicate the time since the last irrigation. The system employs timer interrupts and external interrupts for its operation.

## Drivers Used
* GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
* Timer Interrupts
* External Interrupts

## Task 3: Garage Security System
The garage security system is implemented using hardware components and utilizes a password for protection. If the correct password is entered, the system activates a motor to simulate the opening of the garage door. The elapsed time is displayed on an LCD screen while the motor is running.

## Drivers Used
* GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
* Keypad
* LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
* Timer Interrupts
